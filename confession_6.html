            I …………………………………………………………………………………{PUT IN YOUR NAME} MAKE THIS CONFESSION BASED ON MY FAITH IN THE INTEGRITY OF GOD’S WORD OVER MY LIFE IN JESUS NAME <br> <br>
           FATHER YOU SAID IN NUMBERS 14:28 THAT WHAT I SAY TO YOUR EARS IS WHAT YOU WILL DO FOR ME <br>  <br>
          YOU SAID IN ISAIAH 57:19 THAT YOU WILL CREATE THE FRUITS OF MY LIPS <br>  <br> 
          YOU SAID IN MARK 11:23 THAT I SHALL HAVE WHAT I SAY IN JEREMIAH 1:12 THAT YOU WILL HASTEN TO PERFORM YOUR WORDS IN MY LIFE <br>  <br>
          YOU SAID IN HEBREW 3:1 THAT YOU ARE THE HIGHPRIEST AND THE APOSTLE OF THE SPOKEN WORDS FROM MY MOUTH <br> <br>
          YOU SAID IN HOSEA 14: 2 THAT I SHOULD TAKE WORDS AND TURN TO YOU IN FAITH <br> <br>
          YOU SAID IN ISAIAH 55:11 THAT YOUR WORD SHALL NOT RETURN TO YOU VOID BUT SHALL ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH YOU PURPOSE IT TO DO IN MY LIFE <br> <br>
          YOUR WORD IS PURPOSED TO MAKE ME FRUITFULL AND BECOME A MOTHER OF CHILDREN TO KEEP THE HOUSE
          AS I SPEAK THESE WORDS DAY AND NIGHT AS YOU SAID IN JOSHUA 1:8, I BELIEVE IT SHALL PREVAIL AGAINST INFERTILITY AND BARRENNESS IN JESUS NAME ACTS19:20
          THANK YOU JESUS FOR BEING FAITHFUL TO YOUR WORD

            <p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>1Sa 2:1</b>  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
          </p> <br><br>

          <p style="font-size: 17px;">
            <b>MY MOUTH IS ENLARGED OVER INFERTILITY AND BARRENNESS IN JESUS NAME. I REJOICE IN THE LORD OF FERTILITY BECAUSE HE HAS VISITED ME IN AND WITH TRUTH</b> <br> <br>

            <b>1Sa 2:5</b>  They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. 

            I DECLARE THAT I AM NO LONGER THE BARREN, BUT A MOTHER OF….. {PUT THE NUMBER} <br><br>

            <b>1Sa 1:20</b>  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. <br><br>

            <b>I DECLARE THAT CONCEPTION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN ME FOR I HAVE ASKED FROM THE LORD CHILDREN</b> <br><br>

            <b>Gen 4:25</b>  And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. <br><br> 
            
            <b>1Sa 1:19</b>  And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.  <br><br>

            <b>WHEN MY HUSBAND KNOWS ME IN INTERCOURSE, MY EGGS RECEIVE THE SEED TO CONCEIVE IN JESUS NAME</b> <br><br>

            <b>Exo 23:26</b>  There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.  <br><br>
            
            <b>Deu 7:14</b>  Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle <br><br>

            <b>Deu 28:4</b>, 11  Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee. <br><br>

            <b>Job 21:10</b>  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

            <p style="font-size: 17px;">
              <b>FROM THE ABOVE SCRIPTURES I DECLARE THAT I AM IN THE COVENANT OF FRUITFULNESS IN JESUS NAME</b> <br><br>

              <b>Psa 113:9</b>  He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. <br><br>

              <b>NOW I AM COUNTED AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE CHIDREN ON EARTH IN JESUS NAME. IT IS MY TURN AND TIME TO MAKE HOME WITH MY CHILDREN</b> <br><br>

              <b>Psa 128:3 & 6</b>  Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel. <br><br>

              <b>I AM ……………………………………’S {MENTION THE NAME OF YOUR HUSBAND} WIFE, THEREFORE I AM AS A FRUITFUL VINE BY THE SIDES OF HIS HOUSE, AND MY CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE AS OLIVE PLANTS ROUND ABOUT THE TABLE</b> <br><br>

              <b>Gen 25:21</b>  And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <br><br>
              
              <b>1Sa 1:27</b>  For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: <br><br>
              <b>1Sa 1:11</b>  And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the <br><br>affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. <br><br>
              <b>FROM THE ABOVE SCRIPTURES, I DECLARE MY CONCEPTION OF A CHILD AS ABRAHAM’S DAUGHTER IN JESUS NAME</b><br><br>

              <b>Gen 18:14</b>  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. <br><br>

              <b>Num 11:23</b>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? Mat 19:26  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. 
              thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. <br><br>

              <b>Luk 1:37</b>  For with God nothing shall be impossible. <br><br>

              <b>Gen 18:10</b>  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. <br><br>

              <b>Gen 21:1</b>  And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken <br><br>

              <b>I DECLARE THAT ACCORDING TO THE WORDS ABOVE, MY CASE IS NOT TOO HARD FOR GOD TO ACCOMPLISH. IT IS A LIGHT THING FOR GOD TO GIVE ME CHILDREN WHICH HE ALREADY DID IN AND THROUGH JESUS</b> <br><br>

              <b>Gal 4:27</b>  For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. <br><br>

              <b>Isa 54:1GW</b>  Sing with joy, you childless women who never gave birth to children. Break into shouts of joy, you women who never had birth pains. "There will be more children of women who have been deserted than there are children of married women," says the LORD. <br><br>

              <b>IN JESUS NAME I MAKE ROOM FOR AND WELCOME MY CHILDREN TODAY. THIS IS MY SEASON AND MOMENTS IN JESUS NAME</b> <br><br>

            <p style="font-size: 17px;">
              Gen 29:31 ISV  Later, the LORD noticed that Leah was being neglected, so he made her fertile, while Rachel remained childless. <br><br> 
              
             <b>Gen 29:31JSP</b>  And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren <br><br>
              
              <b>Gen 29:31</b>  And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren <br><br>
 
              <b>Genesis 1: 27</b>, 28 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. <br><br>

              The Word of God declares that God commanded the first family to be fruitful and multiply. God has already made provision for me to be furuitful and to be a mother of children. God cannot lie <br><br> 

              <b>Titus1:2.</b> The Scriptures cannot be broken John10:35. Throughout the Bible, there is nobody who truly served God and remained barren.
              Begin by giving thanks and praises to God in songs. Praise and worship Him. <br><br>
